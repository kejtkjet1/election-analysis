# Election-analysis
Election Analysis with Python

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

We looked to perform election results audit for the election commission. We initially evaluated the winning candidates while working on the class modules, but the election commission also needed to break out the data by additional variables. 
## Election Results

- The contressional election received: 369,711 Total Votes

- Results by county
    - Jefferson: 10.5% (38,855)
    - Denver: 82.8% (306,055)
    - Arapahoe: 6.7% (24,801)

- The county which received the largest nubmer of votes: Denver 306,055

- Resutlts by candidate
    - Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)
    - Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)
    - Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)

The CSV file we used to analize the results: https://github.com/kejtkjet1/election-analysis/blob/main/resources/election_results.csv

The Txt file with the results summary can be located under: https://github.com/kejtkjet1/election-analysis/blob/main/analysis/election_results.txt

## Summary

- This Python Script is very versatile, it can be used to perform elecion audits for other elections. Few possible modifications to make it more versatile
    - We could add additional variables if the csv captured demographics of the voting public and perform similar analysis by demographic breakouts
    - Alternatively we could look to perform an analysis of winning candidates per election district
